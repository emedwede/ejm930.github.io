            <h2>History of Latino Culture, “Spain Today” and “Early Spain”</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>Spain entered the 20th Century after the death of the dictator Franco in 1975.  With beloved King Juan Carlos I as titular head of its multi-party, constitutional democracy, prime minister, and a bicameral legislature, Spain quickly improved its transportation and communication systems and the economy in general improved drastically.  Spain is now a member of the European Union and NATO.</p>
            <p>The #2 Outline and PowerPoint presentation gives three lasting major influences of the Roman Empire: Language, Law, and Christianity and in “Early Spain” it says that Latin (language) and Religion (Christianity) are the two most important, and, indeed, the latter is true.  That is not to say that Law was not important, just that Latin (from whence came the Spanish language) and Christianity (Roman Catholicism) had greater and more far-reaching influence than law.</p>

            <h2>Voices of Latino Culture, Seneca (ca. 4 BCE – 65 CE) Suicide and Slavery</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, is remembered today especially for his statements about ethics (the main thrust of Stoicism), how we should live, how we should die, and how we should treat others.  He was especially esteemed in Roman Spain, where he was born (Córdoba), and some of his ideas appeared to correspond with a new religion--Christianity--that began arriving to the Iberian Peninsula shortly after his death.</p>
            <p>During Seneca's time in the early Roman Empire, slavery was a crucial institution that guaranteed the success of Latin civilization.  Much of the great public works of Roman Spain (as you have seen on our PowerPoint presentation) were built by slaves.  As the Romans conquered the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, and as far north as Great Britain, they enslaved many of the peoples they encountered. Some critics have said that Seneca opposed slavery, but he could not say that publically: it would have been considered an act of treason against the government.</p>
            <p>In Seneca's 47th letter to a young man (Lucilius), Seneca reminds his reader about the proper treatment of slaves.  His basic principle is that masters should treat slaves as they would other human beings ("...treat your inferiors in the way in which you would like to be treated by your own superiors" (12).  "Be kind and courteous in your dealings with a slave," (11) Seneca affirms and this way one will assure the loyalty of the servants.  Proper treatment of slaves includes speaking with them daily, and incorporating them into family life; communication with slaves by masters insures that they won't gossip or betray the family outside of the home (11).</p>
            <p>Seneca reminds Lucilius that the ancestors of the Romans even had a special day in which the masters ate with the slaves (12)which fell to disuse.  This comment is typical of Seneca, as seen in other letters, that the current generation of Romans has strayed from important national traditions and customs. Many of Seneca's writings appear to modern eyes to be very current: here, Seneca reminds haughty masters that they may be another kind of slaves--to sex, money, and ambition (12--conditions that have fascinated contemporary psychologists).</p>
            <p>Seneca is ancient and modern in many of his ideas.  In "On the Taking of One's Own Life" Seneca addresses a problem that makes headlines nearly every day now--the right to die  The concept of suicide was as problematic during Seneca's time as our own Seneca maintains in this letter (the 77th to Lucilius), that the taking of one's own life depends on the person involved and the circumstance. He gives two examples: Tullius Marcellinus (15) and a young Spartan boy (16).  Both suicides follow Seneca's guidance that "life is never incomplete if it is an honorable one" (15). Tullius suffered from a disease that was making his life miserable; he had to be guided by a stoic to organize his household for his death.  The young Spartan boy belonged to a culture that trained young men in the glory of combat (not unlike the Aztec or Inca in the Americas). As the boy was taken as a slave, he was ordered to empty a chamber pot (no modern bathrooms in the ancient world!); as this was such an insult to a young fighter, the boy "dashed his head against the wall and cracked his skull open" (16).  Both deaths illustrate Seneca's concept of suicide: the individual involved had come to the conclusion that it was time to die because of health (Tullius) or honor (the Spartan boy).Seneca maintains that dying is a duty that must be accepted by all (17).  He himself committed suicide when he fell out of the Emperor Nero's favor (see the introduction to this reading).  Overall, Seneca's letters to Lucilius were greatly popular in Roman Spain, and many of his ideas lasted well beyond his death.</p>
            <p>Because both topics (suicide and slavery) stir up strong emotions in contemporary minds,  I will add a few comments on slavery in ancient Rome: First, it is important to note that slavery was common throughout ancient history, indeed until the mid 19th century in Western civilization. It was accepted as a natural part of the social order.  The Romans practiced slavery on a huge scale (at least 40% of the Roman population was slaves). Large numbers of slaves were prisoners-of-war, brought in from conquered lands and sold at auction.  Children of slave women were also slaves and free men would sometimes sell their children (or wife) into slavery as well. </p>
            <p>Some slaves worked in agriculture, on farms producing wheat, olives, grapes, taking care of livestock, etc.  In urban settings, slaves worked in households and in small shops, sometimes even managing the business.  Slaves were especially important in the construction of public works: aqueducts, bridges, roads, arenas, etc.  Some slaves became gladiators (such as Spartacus) and gained fame.Slavery was not based on race, religion or ethnicity.  Some slaves were eventually freed by their grateful owners, some bought their own freedom. Slavery in the Roman Empire eventually died out and was replaced by serfs in rural areas and by low-paid wage laborers in cities.  It did not die out due to moral scruples!</p>

            <h2>María Hinojosa, "Living la Vida Latina"</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>Perhaps you have seen the CNN correspondent María Hinojosa on television or heard her excellent news stories on the radio program "Latino USA."  In her article "Living la Vida Latina," María recalls her youth as a Mexican-American living in a "multiculti" (multicultural) part of Chicago. First moving to New York City as a student and then living there as a professional reporter, she has her first experience in knowing and working with other Latino colleagues from all over the Spanish-speaking world ("...Puerto Ricans, Dominicans...Cubans, Argentines, Peruvians...Salvadorean and Chilean refugees..." (5). She learns that her Mexican culture is but one fabric on the "Hispanic quilt" of her community.  Despite their differences, many New York Latino families share both their Spanish language as well as their experience living together in a new country.  She concludes with the hope that her children can be "Latinos without borders" (6).</p>
