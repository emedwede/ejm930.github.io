            <h2>Voices of Latino Culture, “The Koran”</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>The Koran is central to the life of the world's Muslims, just as it was to the Moors who arrived in Spain in 711.  Since the times of the Prophet Mohammed (born 570 CE), no textual changes have been made.  This reverence to the written word of the Koran is due to the Islamic belief that the Angel Gabriel recited the Koran to Mohammed, telling the Prophet that these were the words of Allah (God).  In fact, Koran means recitation.  </p>
            <p>Our chapter "Mary," from the Koran, demonstrates much of  the focus of the entire Koran and indeed Islam. Mohammed's vision of the new faith, as revealed to him by Allah, included key events and figures from both the Jewish and Christian faiths. In fact, Abraham is the father of all three religions: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim. Other figures in this reading--such as Zacharias, John (the Baptist) (21); and Aaron, Noah, Isaac, Jacob and others (22) may be familiar to readers of the Christian Old and New Testament.  However, in many cases, the Prophet may focus on different aspects of the lives of these revered men and women. </p>
            <p>Such is the case with Jesus and Mary (21).  Islam honors Jesus as the most important prophet before Mohammed himself, and considers his mother Mary the purest of all women. However, the Prophet affirmed that Jesus was not the son of God nor was he divine (this statement is repeated throughout our reading).  Therefore, in the Koran, events concerning Jesus' life are noted, but nothing is said of the resurrection of Jesus (a central tenet for Christians). In "Mary," the birth of Jesus is reported--not in the town of Bethlehem, but of Mary alone giving birth near a palm tree.  Returning to her people, Mary faced many questions ("Mary, this is indeed a strange thing..."). Then the baby Jesus speaks himself (to the surprise of those present): "I am the servant of God...").  The story of the birth of Jesus in the Koran exemplifies the Islamic tendency to incorporate significant traditions from the both Christian and Jewish sources into a new faith shaped by Mohammed and his followers in the 7th century.</p>

            <h2>History of Latino Culture, “Al-Andalus, the Moorish Period”</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>The Moors (Islamic fighters) invaded the Visigothic Iberian Peninsula in 711 C.E. and would remain there until their defeat at Granada in 1492.  It didn’t take them long to conquer the important parts of Hispania (20 some years) and they were finally stopped in what today is southern France by a Frankish army under Charles (“the Hammer”) Martel.  Then, after a few years the Moors fell back for good to the south-side of the Pyrenees. </p>
            <p>It wasn’t long before an effort by the small enclave of Visigothic Christians in the north were making their first efforts in the long struggle to vanquish the Moors and claim the peninsula for Christendom once again (this effort is called the Reconquista or Reconquest).  The “march” (frontier or border) between the Christians and Moors was tenuous and constantly changing.  In thinking about the ebb and flow of battle, it would be wrong to view the efforts of either side as a unified, concerted, and well-executed endeavor.  There was infighting and jockeying for advantage of one sort and another on both sides.  Thus, what was won today in one place might be lost tomorrow in another and so it went.  Remember, this was a protracted conflict lasting nearly 800 years!  (Think of how long the U.S. has been in existence: a little over 225 years.)  On the Muslim side, the two great groups were the Arabs (mostly at the top) and the Berbers (from North Africa and the most numerous in the armies). Al-Andalus as an Empire (Caliphate) only lasted till about 1031 when it collapsed and broke up into smaller kingdoms or taifas, but the high quality of culture and prosperity of the Caliphate was maintained in most areas and improved in many.</p>
