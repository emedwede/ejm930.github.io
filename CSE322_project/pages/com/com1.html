            <h2>Geography of Spain</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>Spain occupies about 80% of the Iberian Peninsula (the rest is Portugal) in the southwest extreme of Europe. In the northeast, Spain borders on France with the Pyrenees Mountains separating them. Spain is separated from North Africa by the Strait of Gibraltar which is less than 8 miles wide at its narrowest point. Spain also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Spain is the third largest country in Europe and is about twice the size of Oregon. </p>
            <p>The most important topographical feature is the central plateau (meseta). The principal mountain chains are the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian Mountains (in the North), the Sierra Nevada (near Granada) and the Sierra Morena (separating Andalucia from central Spain). After Switzerland, Spain is the most mountainous country of Europe. This explains why populations were/are isolated from one another as we will see later on.</p>
            <p>Most major rivers flow west and south to the Atlantic Ocean. The Duero, Tajo (Tagus), and the Guadiana flow through Portugal on their way to the Atlantic. The Guadalquivir (the deepest  and the only one navigable to any extent) flows to the Atlantic coast of Southwest Spain. The Ebro in northeastern Spain flows into the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Roman Spain</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>The story of this era (roughly 1000 BC to 100 BC) is actually one of control over the Mediterranean and its valuable trade routes.  The earliest sea-going visitors to the Iberian Peninsula were the Greeks and the Phoenicians and, later, the Romans and Carthaginians. The latter  two fought a nearly 150-year war (Punic) which the Romans eventually won. (See Maps in Blackboard for helpful historic maps of these events.) When the Romans went inland to conquer the Iberian Peninsula, they found a stubborn foe in the Celtiberians, a people made up of the original Iberians (probably from North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean) and the Celts (from Europe beyond the Pyrenees). Although the Celtiberians did not present a unified defense of their homeland, the Romans had to subdue each city or area independently (hence the term guerrilla or “little war”) which proved costly and time-consuming. The siege at Numancia is a famous example of the tenacity and brutality of the long campaign.</p>
