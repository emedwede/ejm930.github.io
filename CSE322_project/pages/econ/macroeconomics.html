            <h2>Production Possibilites Curve and What Does it Mean?</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>For my example, I am choosing a company that has a plant that can produce tablets and laptops. In total the company can either produce 200 tablets with all resources devoted to tablets and 100 laptops with all resources devoted to laptops. Graphing the information with tablets on the Y-axis and laptops on the X-axis you will see the graph below.</p>

        <section>
            <p>Depending how much of each type of good produced, the company will be at a point somewhere on the curve. If the company is not allocating resources properly, the production will be inside the curve. And, any point outside the curve would be a different production possibility. For simplicity sake, the slope on this will always be -2 or -2 tablets / 1 laptop. Depending on how much per each good the company makes, they may want to produce more of one over the other.  However, they must always know the cost of the opportunity forgone. So, there you have it. A production possibilities curve is just that – a graphical representation of the possible combination of goods produced and the opportunity forgone.</p>

            <h2>Supply and Demand - A Childrens Tale</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <h4>Part 1</h4>
            <p>It was an early Monday afternoon when Shanny came up with a brilliant idea. For a long time he had been wanting to save up for the new video game coming out in a month called Econ Quest. However, he hadn’t been able to come up with more than twenty dollars and time was running out. So, he concocted the great idea to sit out in front of his house and sell Anime advice. Shanny proceeded to set up his table and he figured he could charge people two dollars to be fair. After a few hours he realized that not too many people were willing to pay the two dollars for the advice. In order for him to make a change in the quantity demanded, Shanny lowered his price to $1.50. To his surprise he began to get more people who were willing to pay for his advice. Finally on the rise and no longer unsure of whether he could reach his goal, Shanny set up his table the next day with a new idea! He knew that lowering his price would make more people want advice, but he wanted to keep the same price and still get more people to take his Anime advice. So, to keep it simple – because Shanny already knew that there were a lot of people in his neighborhood that liked Anime and could afford to pay a $1.50 for advice – Shanny began to focus on his customer’s preferences and expectations. In no time, people were coming back asking for more recommendations and Shanny reached his goal! Now, the rest of this story is left for part 2, supply.</p>

            <h4>Part 2</h4>
            <p> It was an exciting day! Only a week left until Econ Quest came out and he had more than enough to buy the game and get a controller to play with his Math friend from school Allen. Shanny was really excited by how he reached his goal and exceeded it and wanted to keep offering advice. But, his math friend Allen informed Shanny that if he kept this up, he’d have no time to play Econ Quest or Space Math with his friend Allen. So, in order to start scaling down for the release of Econ Quest, Shanny began to supply less of his service over the course of the week. What he didn’t realize though, is the people who had come to his booth really liked his service and he was now supplying less than what his customers demanded. Allen was right, and Shanny was stuck in a difficult spot. What should he do? He still wanted to occasionally recommend anime, but he wanted to have time to play his new game. For Shanny, this was the first step in learning how supply worked. He had to start taking into account the returns he would get for doing an alternative activity. As he thought and thought, he came to a great conclusion! He could occasionally get one of his expert Anime friends Lisa to fill in for him to increase the number of suppliers of Anime recommendations, while he worked on the next phase of his plan! Shanny devised a great idea to have his Computer friend Eric to make a website for him using technology. Shanny could then put his top recommendations on the site for free and have his customer’s login. Then, he could get his neighbors and their friends to sign up for a twice a month email list of recommendations at his booth on Sundays. Whether or not his plan would work remained to be seen. Nonetheless, Shanny learned about how supply works and the factors that it affects that day. And, he ended thoughts of his master plan for offering advice, while playing Econ Quest with his friend Allen that day. </p>
