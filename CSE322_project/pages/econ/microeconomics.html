                <h4>Capital intensive and labor intensive</h4>
                <p>Capital Intensive refers to when a firm is shifting more of its ratio of production to capital, whereas labor intensive refers to when a firm is shifting more of its ratio of production to labor. Both of these terms are dually related. Usually when a firm shifts more production towards capital, it will eventually get to a point where it has to shift more of its production back to labor.</p>

                <h4>economies of scale and the LRAC curve</h4>
                <p>Economies of scale occur when the Long Run Average Cost decreases over time as the firm expands out. This can be seen on an LRAC curve (Long Run Average Cost curve) near the beginning of the graph. LRAC curves are primarily used to represent information about the long run costs of production and can show whether or not a firm experience’s an economies of scale, a diseconomies of scale, or constant returns to scale.</p>

                <h4>short run and long run</h4>
                <p>The short run is where a firm takes into account fixed costs and variable costs, whereas the long run only deals with variable costs. Both the short run and the long run are inter-related because they help predict the total costs a business is going to incur. In the short run, reallocation of resources can be more difficult; however, in the long run it becomes much more flexible.</p>

                <h4>negative marginal returns and total output</h4>
                <p>Negative marginal returns occur when labor added actually reduces the total output. The total output, on the other hand, is how much a plant can produce based on the amount of labor, technology, etc. that they have. Over time, any successful plant will want to maximize its output. By adding more works, the total output should increase, right? Well, this is true for most circumstances; however, there is a point where the returns start to diminish so drastically, it actually becomes a loss. This is the point of negative marginal returns. To easily think about what could cause this, imagine a heavily overcrowded Burger King, where the person cooking couldn’t even reach the spatula to flip the burger! That would certainly lead to less burgers cooked!</p>
